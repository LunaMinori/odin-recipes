            <ol>
                <li><p>Allow butter and eggs to stand at room temperature  for 30 minutes. In a small bowl
                        pour the boiling water over the oats. Stir until combined; let stand for 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
                        grease and lightly flour a 9-inch springform pan; set pan aside. In a medium bowl stir together
                        flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg; set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>Preheat oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl beat the butter with an electric mixer on
                        medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.; beat
                        until well combined. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Alternately
