            <ol>
                <li><p>Allow eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, grease and lightly flour two 9x1 1/2-inch round cake pans.
                        Set pan(s) aside. In a small bowl stir together cocoa powder and food coloring; set aside. In another small bowl stir together
                        flour and salt; set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>Preheat oven to 350F. In a large mixing boat beat shortening  with an electric mixer  on medium to high  speed for 30 seconds.
                        Add sugar and vanilla; beat until  well combined. Add eggs one at a time, beating on medium speed after each addition until combined.
                        Best in cocoa mixture. Alternately add flour mixture and buttermilk, beating on low to medium speed after each addition just until 
                        combined. Add to batter, mixing until combined. Spread batter into prepared pan(s).</p></li>
                <li><p>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes for round pans, 30 minutes for 13x9x2-inch pan, or until  a wooden toothpick inserted near center(s) comes
