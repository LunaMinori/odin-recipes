            <! -- Small description of the Cake -->
                <dl><em><p>Don't let the fact that you have only two cake pans stop
                    you from making this stunning three-layer beauty.
                    Just bake in shifts, refrigerating the batter for the third
                    layer while the first two layers bake.

                                <!--All Steps Needed to Make Recipe-->
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Allow butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, 
                                            grease and lightly flour three 8x1 1/2-inch or 9x1 1/2-inch round cake pans; 
                                            set pans aside. In a medium bowl stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, 
                                            and salt; set aside.</li>
                                        <li>Preheat oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl beat butter  with an electric mixer  
                                            on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar, lemon pel, and lemon juice; beat 
                                            until well combined. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
                                            Alternatively add flour mixture and buttermilk to butter mixture, beating on low speed 
                                            after each addition just until combined. Spread into prepared pans.</li>
                                        <li>Bake for 28 to 32 minutes for the 8-inch pans, 25 to 28 minutes for the 9-inch pans, or
                                            until a wooden toothpick inserted near centers come out clean. Cool cake layers in pans
                                            on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove cake layers from pans. Cool thoroughly on wire racks.</li>
                                        <li>To assemble, turn two layers bottom sides up; spread with filling of choice. Stack these
                                            layers on top, rounded (top) side up. Frost top and sides with frosting of choice.</li>
                                    </ol>
